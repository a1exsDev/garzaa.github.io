        <h3>Shutdown</h3>
        <p>In July 2039, NASA abruptly ended the LAM initiative<sup>[13]</sup>. It was replaced in 2042 by <span class="flink">ADAM</span><sup>[14]</sup>, which used a combination of automated and remote-controlled drones to mine asteroids. An official reason for the shutdown was never given, but speculations include human error at the now-abandoned <span class="flink">Station C</span> or an early discovery of <span class="flink">Riemann Syndrome</span><sup>[15]</sup>.</p>

<p>“Mind the gap,” murmured the shuttle as I stepped through the airlock. I took my place inside with the rest of the crew, and sighed a bit in relief as the doors closed, shutting out the Florida summer heat.</p>
<p>“Pressurizing the cabin now,” said one of the pilots from up front. “You boys might want to swallow.” I’d been through this before, but gulped anyway to pop my ears.</p>
<p>The shuttle lurched as we floated away from the tower. So did my gut, as I remembered the question the officer had asked me before we boarded.</p>
<p>“Have you taken any drugs in the last twenty-four hours, Cooper? Even something as minor as acetaminophen, because the orbit warp can—”</p>
<p>“No, sir,” I replied, with measured calmness. “I’m a veteran at this, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>And I am a veteran at this. The program’s only been active for two years and I’ve already completed twelve mining missions, more so than any of the other people on this shuttle. I’ve probably been on more missions than either of the pilots. Twelve is enough for some pretty generous pay from NASA, but when you consider the risks involved with a prolonged spacewalk and the value of some of those metals we cut out of the asteroids, it seems fair.</p>
<p>But every single time we warp into orbit, I get a pounding headache. That’s the unfair part, since nobody else I’ve talked to has gotten it. I didn’t mention it to anybody higher up since I don’t want to lose my job.</p>
<p>“Accelerating to match the position of: Station C,” informed the soft voice of the shuttle’s autopilot. The jump was coming up soon.</p>
<p>So today, in anticipation of the ordeal, I had taken two Tylenol, despite any kind of substance being verboten to LAM astronauts. It was like the cell phone rule they had for airplanes, I had rationalized to myself, a decade later and the FAA realized all the electronics were so shielded against outside interference that a few stray signals from inside the cabin that the phone ban was useless.</p>
<p>There was a thump and a flash of white from the small windows as we passed the sound barrier.</p>
<p>I guess now I was a little less sure. Nobody really knows what goes on during a warp, even though it only lasts a millisecond. It hasn’t fried anyone’s brain yet, though, and it was apparently tested on hundreds of small animals before any humans were put through it. Besides, I’ve already done a mission like this twelve times. I don’t think a few Tylenol pills would screw it up.</p>
<p>“Prepare for warp,” came the robotic voice. I got that vague rush of nervousness that never quite goes away, the realization that you’re about to be flung through a twisted knot of space in a piece of metal powered by mere computers. Software for the warp tech was written in a programming language that was nearly a century old at this point, and all anyone can do is hope it still works.</p>
<p>From behind us, we heard the whine of the supercomputer and the Origami drive spinning up. The other crewmembers peered through the windows to watch as, ahead, the sky began to distort and fold in on itself. In a moment, there was a dark gash full of stars a half-mile in front of the shuttle, which was nothing at the speed we were moving.</p>
<p>My vision went black for a second as we went from speeding over the Florida swamps to hanging a thousand miles over the Pacific ocean. One of my eyes saw blackness, like it was closed. The other saw stars in the window, and the structure of Station C drifting closer as the pilots started the docking sequence. The disparity ended after a few seconds, and left me staring at the space station.</p>
<p>That was odd, I thought, as my stomach started floating. Loss of vision has never happened before. But then again, if something’s gonna ruin my streak of perfect missions, it’s definitely not going to be a little bit of Tylenol. I looked out the window, grateful for the absence of sunlight. We had warped to the night-side of Earth, and the only things we could see were the station’s blinking lights, the white circle of the docking port, and farther out, the massive skeletal struts of the asteroid gate.</p>
<p>The shuttle shook and then went still as it clamped onto the docking port. We filed out, nearly silently. I recognized a man named Ramirez from the last mining trip. Was he the same person as last time, or had he changed since I last saw him? Something was definitely different, but it was small, like a haircut or a loss of a few pounds. The last mission I did with him was a few months ago, and people can really change in the time between jumps. Aside from him, though, everybody looked pretty new. Which was okay, because I was here to show them how everything worked.</p>
<p>As we began the long, laborious process of getting on our mining suits, I kept thinking about the blackout. I guess it was just another thing to add to my list of vaguely troubling personal symptoms I had whenever we warped into orbit. This endless fascination with my own sickness was getting to me though, and it was becoming a bit of a struggle to keep myself grounded.</p>
<p>The thermal underwear came first. Contrary to popular opinion, it’s not the cold that’s a problem in space, it’s the heat. In a vacuum, there’s nothing to draw heat away from the body, and during a physically intensive operation like this, we need some artificial cooling. That, combined with the oxygen supply and the fuel for the mining tools meant our spacesuits were pretty bulky.</p>
<p>We silently attached our helmets, and the radios inside came alive as people started chattering to test them. I didn’t feel like talking much. I wanted to attribute it to my stoic, veteran exterior, but my mind was on the warp.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ramirez,” I said.</p>
<p>“Howdy, Cooper,” came the response. Ramirez had watched too much space anime in his youth, and took on some barely tolerable affectations.</p>
<p>“Do you know if anyone’s ever died during a warp?”</p>
<p>“Died during? Not as far as I know. There was that one pilot back in, oh, the early 2030s who warped into something solid. I forget what, I think it was a cliff or something. But that was only because he fucked up the coordinates. He was already dead when he hit the warp button.”</p>
<p>“Huh. Alright.”</p>
<p>Maybe I’m already dead and don’t realize it. This could be my life flashing before my eyes, and I’d never know.</p>
<p>“Asteroid’s coming in,” someone shouted. The lights on the observation deck turned red, telling anybody outside to get the hell in before they were bodied by a rock. On the other side of the station, the outer warp gate lit up. Operators shouted to each other over the intercoms, making sure the space around the gate was clear of any shuttles or maintenance drones, and gave the O.K.</p>
<p>The stars that we could see through the circle of the gate folded through each other and belched out an asteroid the size of a house. The stabilizers they had planted on it out at that lonely station in the belt kicked in, rockets flaring as they brought it to a stop right in front of the window.</p>
<p>“Damn, that’s a big one,” said one of the crew members.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen bigger,” I said quietly.</p>
<p>Silently, without any warning, the sun began to rise, a brilliant light coming around the edge of the planet. If our helmets weren’t polarized, we’d be almost blinded. The asteroid itself was silhouetted against the Pacific, which was a perfect shade of blue underneath the few clouds down at the surface.</p>
<p>“MK-50,” came the voice through the radio. “Keep your minds on the job and this could be done in one go.”</p>
<p>The code meant we’d be extracting magnetic ore this time, and were free to kick waste material down into the atmosphere to burn up, as long as it was under 50 kg. That, in turn, meant the material was pretty dense, so they gave us an extra tank of gas for the cutting tool.</p>
<p>We filed out of the airlock one by one, each taking a place of our own on the huge mass and began the excavation.</p>
<p>The damn black flash during the jump kept coming back to haunt me as I worked. Maybe something strange did happen.</p>
<p>But to be honest, despite my long-standing veteran status, I didn’t have much of an idea how warps worked. The only thing I remember learning in school was reading a report by the original research team, where they put one mouse through the first tiny warp gate and described seeing two for a split-second: one in each gate on either side of the room, before the first one disappeared into the void.</p>
<p>It’s like looking through a window from both sides, one of the researchers had written. It appears to be two objects, but they’re one and the same, and one has to disappear fully for the other to exist.</p>
<p>Which makes sense, I thought, as I carved around a tricky piece of ore and sent the debris tumbling down below me. You can’t have two of the same thing existing at once, and if you did, how would you know which one was the original?</p>
<p>I couldn’t shake the feeling that part of me had died during that process, or at least a different part of me. Maybe that was what I was seeing when we came out of the warp: the last flashes of vision from the half I left behind. Was I the original? Was the original me just cloned into orbit along with the shuttle and the rest of the crew, and left to die in whatever in-between dimension existed during the warp when it closed?</p>
<p>My cutting tool shook a little bit as I worked. I was getting sloppy, cutting off little nicks and corners of the ore vein I was trying to preserve.</p>
<p>And if so, had that happened twelve times? Were there twelve cold, dead Coopers floating outside the world, or just the idea of them after they vanished into the warp? I’d be nothing but a reflection of a reflection. The twelfth iteration of a corpse in the hall of mirrors.</p>
<p>I sliced dangerously close to my wrist. The cutter flashed for a second as it caught the rising sun, and I suddenly regretted going on all of those missions. If my theory were true, I wouldn’t be just one clone. I’m a tiny fraction of my original self by now, piece by piece sheared off during transit between earth and sky.</p>
<p>I took a break from mining for a minute to look at the blade secured to my right forearm, tilted it so it would catch the light again. It shone; a golden invitation. The mining tools were more Origami space-warping tech, blades and picks edged with a shivering distortion field that would tear apart anything they came into contact with.</p>
<p>Ramirez was the next in line to me, in terms of missions completed and original soul remaining. I turned off the power to my right arm and spoke into my radio to summon him.</p>
<p>“Ramirez, could you give me a hand here? I think one of my cutters is broken.”</p>
<p>He came floating blithely over and took my hand in his.</p>
<p>“Shoot, your power’s just off, Cooper,” he said, and gave a sensible chuckle. “After twelve missions, I feel like you’d be better at this.”</p>
<p>It was time for Ramirez to find himself again. I re-activated the blade and smashed it through his helmet. Watched as the air rushed out, as his eyes bulged and his cheeks turned purple. Maybe he was back in the shuttle on his first mission right now, but having gathered up all the missing pieces of his soul.</p>
<p>“Control, this is Cooper,” I said. “Ramirez has gone home.”</p>
<p>He’s dead. We’re all dead. Everyone in Station C has warped here, and we’re all husks bounding around in zero gravity. We left our souls behind on Earth long, long ago. My helmet radio is going crazy now, but what they’re saying doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p>I unclipped the blade so I could point it at my chest. Maybe, after this, I’ll be myself again. Somewhere out there is the original version of Jeremy Cooper, floating in the dead space outside our world.</p>
<p>“Hold on, Cooper,” I said. “I’m coming for you.”</p>

    <h3>Riemann Syndrome</h3>
<p><em><sup>(redirected from Warp Sickness)</em></sup></p>
<p><b>Riemann Syndrome</b>, colloquially known as Warp Sickness, is an <span class="flink">autonomous bodily reaction</span> exhibited by some individuals who have undergone a <span class="flink">warp</span> while under the influence of any mind-altering substance<sup>[1]</sup>. It is characterized by a number of psychological and physical reactions, most notably <span class="flink">depersonalization</span>, partial loss of vision, and the conviction that the afflicted has died during the warp and been only partially resurrected<sup>[2]</sup>. Suicidal or homicidal urges are an extremely rare effect<sup>[3]</sup>. Treatments include extended <span class="flink">cognitive therapy</span><sup>[4]</sup>, but no complete cure has been found. It was discovered in 2040 by psychologist <span class="flink">Anton Riemann</span> during his work with ex-<span class="flink">LAM</span> participants<sup>[5]</sup>.</p>
