    <p><b>August 20</b></p>
    <p>We all met up by Milo’s grave one last time today. Nothing special about it, really, just to put a few flowers down and shoot the breeze before we all separate for school in the swiftly approaching fall.</p>
    <p>It’s an unseasonably cold, cloudy day, and the fact that we didn’t meet until the late afternoon isn’t helping things any. Blame people for not having their lives together, I guess, but then again how could I, in the wake of a death.</p>
    <p>It’s a weird thing to think about; how different everyone is compared to three months ago. Exactly three months ago, actually. For example, Phoenix is relaxed now, staring straight ahead through her bangs. Her hair looks nice short. She hasn’t said much, aside from a “Hey, Alex” when I arrived. We were both early. She still bites her nails.</p>
    <p>Chark is on the other side of everyone, hands in his pockets and squinting against the diffuse sunlight. I keep forgetting how much weight he lost over the summer. And his natural hair color under the blue is brown, which is interesting. I was guessing blond this entire time. He’s wearing a dark coat and black pants. I’d expect him to have a little flash of color with a scarf or something, but no. It’s like he’s decided to become a monk and pursue a life of asceticism.</p>
    <p>I give him a tight-lipped smile as I walk past. I don’t know if he’s forgiven me, or whether I should ask how his Kiff is doing. He might take it as a cruel joke, and I think we’ve all had enough of those for the summer.</p>
    <p>Nick and Allie are even dressed nicely (coats instead of hoodies, no weird striped track pants) and holding hands for once, which is a quiet surprise. I guess we all thought it would happen someday. They smile sheepishly when I walk over to talk to them, but remain holding hands.</p>
    <p>“So, this is happening, huh?” I say.</p>
    <p>“Well—” begins Nick.</p>
    <p>“Yeah,” says Allie.</p>
    <p>They smile at each other again, and I decide to leave them alone for the time being.</p>
    <p>The little bits reminding me of early June just drive home the fact that Milo’s gone. It’s like this summer has brought us closer together, sheltered one side of all of us from the elements until it became open and raw. And although we all reacted to it differently, even when people tried to be harder on the outside you could still see exactly why they were doing it.</p>
    <p>Nathan combed his hair for today, and was back to wearing glasses, I guess for old times’ sake. He and Mary are standing weirdly, not exactly holding hands, but there’s still a good deal of arm-hand contact going on. Maybe it’s finally happening, after all their debating about it during the summer. God, why am I looking for this now? Milo wouldn’t. Would he? He’d always been emotional, but still respectful of things like this. Never too judgmental, though.</p>
    <p>Josh begins speaking, making everyone else fall silent. It’s an informal affair, but at least most of us know enough to just stand around and listen to him talk. I tune him out, though, to focus on rearranging my own thoughts.</p>
    <p>Geg’s here somewhere, too. Greg. If there were ever a time for us to stop calling him Geg, it’s today. I guess it should have been a few months ago, but the summer is technically still happening. I saw him mournfully eating some flowers right as I got here, but I know he’s lurking somewhere behind me. I don’t want to turn around and look for him while Josh is talking, but at least I don’t think he was eating the flowers we left on the grave.</p>
    <p>“I’d like to end with a little silence for everyone,” says Josh. “Take it to think about Milo or anything that’s been on your mind.”</p>
    <p>Naturally eloquent, even though he was only on speech and debate in high school for a month before quitting for water polo, which I admire him for. I’ve never played water polo, but it takes a lot of effort, apparently. Of course Josh won’t tell me how much. He’s too humble. He’ll probably be sainted or knighted or something when he goes to study in that Oxford program next year. If only he tried to stop looking and dressing like a frat bro before he left, but if he’s been doing that for the last two years he’s not going to stop now.</p>
    <p>I’m not going to say anything this time. I don’t have any words anymore.</p>
    <p>We all say our goodbyes for the next four months. Well, Josh, Nathan and I do, because we’ll be a few thousand miles away from each other and the rest of the town, but everyone else mumbles polite things to each other because they’ll be here all year. I wouldn’t mind going to college here, I guess, but there’s something to be said for a larger university, especially if it’s actually in or near a big city. </p>
    <p>I decide to try to talk to Chark for the first time in a few months, and realize I don’t really know enough about him to try to start a conversation.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know you and your friends very well over the summer,” he says as I approach.</p>
    <p>“I mean, it was your choice.”</p>
    <p>“And I’m kinda glad,” he continues, “because despite what Phoenix thinks, you’re all some of the most fucked-up people I’ve ever met.”</p>
    <p>I gape at him for a second, but quickly recover.</p>
    <p>“Maybe you should have known us better,” I mumble, but he’s already stalked off to head out with Phoenix.</p>
    <p>That’s it, then. I’m going to get on a plane tomorrow. Back to Los Angeles for another four months, with nothing to show for my summer. Nothing I can put on my resume, at least. </p>
    <p>Let my former best friend die after a year of resentment and drama.</p>
    <p>Bad interpersonal skills.</p>
    <p>Self-starter.</p>
    <p>Yeah. That’s it, I guess. </p>
    <p>I don’t want to write more right now, anyway.</p>
    <p><b>August 19</b></p>
    <p>I’m taking one last run around town and the woods just to see everything before I leave and before we all get together tomorrow. It’s early, so the cloud cover hasn’t been burned off, and when I ran over the bridge where I met Josh after the party that purple fog was coming off the river. You could barely see the radio tower through it, and the hill where Allie and I stayed until the sun came up was completely shrouded. </p>
    <p>I’m gonna miss listening to the birds and the breeze off the mountains, but at the same time I think these artifacts will always remind me of this summer. The next time I come home, I wonder if I’ll be able to enjoy it. I wonder if anyone will even remember.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>August 14</b></p>
    <p>Decided to do something nice for my parents for once, so I’m going grocery shopping for them. It’s only a ten minute drive to the store from my house at the speed I’m driving, but secretly I just want an excuse to experience this town again before I have to leave. I’m also still uncomfortably full of emotions, and I’m not sure whether I want to tell people about them or drink and fuck them away in college or what. I have a weird urge to pull out my phone and just start taking video, even though this isn’t even a scenic part of town. Rusty bridge against blurry trees. Litter on the side of the road. Old man out for a walk, back hunched and five-pound weights in hand.</p>
    <p>One of the songs Allie recommended to me weeks ago comes up on shuffle, perfect to listen to while speeding down the single highway with the windows down. It’s noisy and indie and punk and weird, just like her, and despite not being a fan of the genre, the lyrics speak to me for the first time in a while.</p>
    <p><i>Doing 180 on the Don Valley Parkway</i></p>
    <p><i>Yeah I’d be better off dead</i></p>
    <p><i>I don’t give a shit, I just don’t wanna die and I don’t wanna live again</i></p>
    <p>Milo’s been reincarnated in our heads. But our versions of him are discrete and pale after-images, one that never screwed up another person for life and another that kept people emotionally tied to him, hoping for just a little bit more in a response that he never gave.</p>
    <p><i>I just don’t know what to do, I’m still fucked up over you!</i></p>
    <p>I skip to the next song.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>August 5</b></p>
    <p>Phoebe and I probably had our last phone call for the summer today. </p>
    <p>“You’re so obsessive!” she shouted, after I kept saying the same things over and over.</p>
    <p>“I know! I’m trying to work on it!” (I did know, but I wasn’t working on it.)</p>
    <p>The last phone call for probably forever, actually. I’ve really destroyed things with her. All the frustration with our terrible communication skills (something I’ve actually been trying to work on, but she makes it hard) and the fact that I can’t stop venting to her about Milo, even making up feelings on the spot to try to coax anything else from her. </p>
    <p>I ended up telling her everything I felt about him (everything!), and it all went to shit. After almost a minute of awkward silence, she disconnected. </p>
    <p>I took out my window screen and climbed out onto the roof, quietly because it’s 2 in the morning and my parents are asleep, and now I’m listening to Slowdive and drinking my last beer and looking at the stars. I wish I could do everything over again. Be King Arthur; meet my Merlin who ages backwards and might be able to keep me from screwing up too badly.</p>
    <p><b>August 2</b></p>
    <p>“I’ve decided art is bullshit,” says Josh.</p>
    <p>We’re hanging out on his roof. He rips a piece out of the sketchbook on his knees and tosses it down into the neighbor’s trash can.</p>
    <p>“What were you drawing?”</p>
    <p>“Fucking birds.”</p>
    <p>Birds are probably hard to draw. I wouldn’t know. Josh scribbles halfheartedly on the next page, and then shuts the book with a clap and lies back.</p>
    <p>“I already know I’m bad at art. I’ll probably be bad at it forever. But why am I not pursuing the other things I’m good at? Is it to make you and everyone else feel better?”</p>
    <p>Well, that came out of nowhere.</p>
    <p>“What?”</p>
    <p>“I mean, shit, Alex, I’ve always known you vaguely resented me, and I’m not too stupid to know why, but what was I supposed to do, not be good at everything? I just feel like I’m wasting my life if I’m not getting better at the things I’m already good at.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t vaguely resent you. Not anymore. That was more of a high school thing. It’s probably more vague admiration now.”</p>
    <p>Josh smiles faintly. I think he could sense the kernel of truth in that.</p>
    <p>“That’s good, I guess.”</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>July 29</b></p>
    <p>Mary calls me, in tears about Nathan. </p>
    <p>I immediately go into juicy-details mode, ready to genuinely help her with what I assume is her budding love for Nathan, when she reveals to me that he’s been kicking her ass in a video game and is being a dick about it.</p>
    <p>Alright. Not what I was expecting, but that’s fine too. I will do my best not to seem mildly annoyed.</p>
    <p>“Do you think it’s a manifestation of any other feelings?” I ask, hoping for something more than just Nathan reveling in the fact that he’s finally better than Mary at a video game.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know,” she says, sniffing. Which isn’t really a surprise, since nobody in this town seems to know anything anymore. “I do just feel kinda distracted sometimes. Maybe I’m growing out of video games.”</p>
    <p>Like that’s possible. </p>
    <p>“Growing out of video games?” I say. “Is such a thing even possible?” It is possible, and it’s happened to me. But she doesn’t need to hear that.</p>
    <p>“Hah. Who knows.”</p>
    <p>“I think learning to get your ass kicked is part of a healthy, balanced friendship,” I say. “And you’ve probably been better at this stuff than Nathan for however long you’ve known each other, six years?”</p>
    <p>“Eight years.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah. He probably just doesn’t know how to deal with winning. I’d say just give him some time. And just talk to him! Tell him he’s being a dick.”</p>
    <p>“Alex, you know how he is. If I talk to him, he’ll just laugh it off.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, yeah.” Nathan ruthlessly kicking my ass was part of the reason I grew out of video games, and telling him he was being a jerk about it just made the situation worse.</p>
    <p>“I’ll just gently make fun of him for being a bad winner or something. He responds the best to weird oblique stuff like that.”</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>July 27</b></p>
    <p>I decided to give Phoebe a call today. Something about her voice brings back some very strong memories of high school.</p>
    <p>“What’s up?” she asks, and for some reason I panic at the fact that I don’t really have an answer.</p>
    <p>“Just wanted to see how you were holding up, I guess.”</p>
    <p>I can feel her frown, like she and Milo would at me.</p>
    <p>“I’m fine, Alex. Really. I’m just trying to put everything behind me.”</p>
    <p>“Are you sure that’s such a good idea?”</p>
    <p>“I mean, it’s better than fixating on it, which I hear you’re still doing.”</p>
    <p>“Hey, nothing wrong with giving it some time in my head. Where did you hear that, anyway?”</p>
    <p>“I still talk to people from high school besides you, you know.”</p>
    <p>“Huh, okay.”</p>
    <p>The awkward silence is palpable. Phoebe makes some excuse about having to go again, and despite my desire to tell her to stay and talk some more I let her go.</p>
    <p>I don’t even know what else we’d talk about. She’s trying to put everything from high school out of her life, not because of any grudge, but because it just doesn’t interest her anymore. We don’t really have a connection.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>July 26</b></p>
    <p>It just turned midnight. I’m up on the hill by the radio tower again, sitting on one of the old picnic benches and imagining we’re all there watching fireworks again. Talking to Geg and his mom earlier today left me vaguely uneasy, like she knew everything about what had happened and was judging me for being a bystander.</p>
    <p>Which is fair, because I’ve been judging myself for the same thing. Just not to an appropriate enough degree. Case in point, the last time I was up here with Josh and Nick and Allie. I could have talked about the Geg thing with them, and that would have opened up a way to get to the bottom of why Nick “wasn’t a huge fan” of Milo, but no: I sat, watched the fireworks, and tried to sidetrack the conversation with some half-baked demonstration of my own intelligence.</p>
    <p>I sigh and start to get up to walk to my car when I notice a little red light a dozen feet away. It glows a bit brighter for a second as I peer at it, waves around in the dark.</p>
    <p>I must have made some puzzled noise because the cigarette drops to the ground and goes out as a girl’s voice says, “Jesus! Alex, is that you?”</p>
    <p>“Allie? What are you doing out here?”</p>
    <p>“I dunno, man. Same thing you’re doing. Thinking, I guess.”</p>
    <p>She sounds less cheerfully irreverent than usual. Should I ask?</p>
    <p>“Thinking about what? If you don’t mind talking about it, that is.”</p>
    <p>“Remember when I joked to you about someone dying at Josh’s party?” she says, and it’s clear she’s had a while to arrange her thoughts. “And remember how it actually happened?”</p>
    <p>“Mmm...” I say, trying to channel Nick from the last time we were here.</p>
    <p>“Nick makes that noise that a lot, usually when he’s about to say something he doesn’t want to commit to,” she said. “Anyway, about him, and everything. I haven’t told anybody, but—”</p>
    <p>“We know you guys are into each other. I know, at least.”</p>
    <p>‘No. I mean, true, but...” She sighs. “No. I hooked up with Josh before I knew Nick had a thing for me, but that was before, and it’s so much stupid drama to juggle, but I guess the point is that I feel bad about everything. I shouldn’t, but I do. And I cope with it like I do everything, by making stupid jokes.”</p>
    <p>So it was never really about his death. I’ve been getting the sense over the years that nothing outside Allie’s personal sphere matters to her much.</p>
    <p>“So your bullshit with Nick is more important than the death of a friend? Is that it?” Let her make a stupid joke about that.</p>
    <p>“Fuck, dude, I guess.” I wasn’t expecting her to agree. “But I’m gonna have to side with Nick on this one, Alex. I wasn’t a huge fan of Milo, and I know he’s dead, and it sucks and it shouldn’t have happened, but he was kinda creepy around me.”</p>
    <p>“Creepy? Like how?”</p>
    <p>Allie pulls her hood over her head. “Just little things. Wouldn’t stop talking to me after I made it clear I wasn’t interested. I stopped drinking so much at parties because every time I got gross he’d always be, like, hovering around me. It was weird shit, okay?”</p>
    <p>I want to ask where Nick was during all this, but I don’t know if she’ll get angry at me for assuming Nick has to be the one taking care of her. </p>
    <p>“That sucks,” I say lamely.</p>
    <p>“Don’t tell me you didn’t notice.” She looks at me, we make uncomfortable eye contact for a second before I look away. “Oh my god, you didn’t. You really were that weirdly obsessed with him.”</p>
    <p>“I’m an obsessive person, okay.” It’s not even a question, just me mentioning who I am. It’s tipped with a reassurance, although I’m not sure which one of us I’m reassuring.</p>
    <p>“Yes! I noticed. But you’re mostly a good person, when you’re actually doing things.”</p>
    <p>I suppress the urge to say “What’s that supposed to mean?” because I know exactly what she means. I’ve known it for years, and unfortunately that passive part of me is exactly what keeps me from changing it.</p>
    <p>Allie is silent, staring out at the town below us.</p>
    <p>“Man, I’m tired,” she says. I don’t know how to interpret it.</p>
    <p>“I’m gonna stay here for a while longer,” I reply after a pause, “but you can go back if you want.”</p>
    <p>“It’s cool. I think I’m gonna stay. I think this is the first real conversation I’ve had in a while,” says Allie.</p>
    <p>“Me too.”</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>July 25</b></p>
    <p>I went over to Geg’s house today, for no reason other than I just wanted to maybe talk about what Milo and Josh did. His mom is probably the nicest person I’ve ever met, or maybe she just wanted me to feel at home because she knows her son is a fucking weirdo and that I’m one of the only people to ever visit him. She gives me cookies, like it’s the sixties, and calls Geg down from whatever he was doing in his room. </p>
    <p>Nobody has any idea what his hobbies are. We all just assume he hangs upside down in his closet all day, like a bat. </p>
    <p>“Alex!” His face lights up when he sees me. I brace for a hug or something weird, but instead he just sits down at the table as his mom wanders off to another part of the house. His weird, normally fidgety hands are calm on the lace tablecloth.</p>
    <p>“Hey, Geg. You doing alright?” </p>
    <p>“Yeh.” </p>
    <p>“I just wanted to say that Milo told me what happened. I’m sorry about it. I still don’t know what to say, or how we can even make it up to you.” </p>
    <p>“S’alright,” he says, refusing to meet my eyes. We stay like that for a second, and then he shrugs. “I’m over it.” </p>
    <p>His speech impediment is much less noticeable for some reason. It's only now that I come to the realization that it might not have existed for the last six years. </p>
    <p>“I just don’t really know where to go from here. Should I tell people? What do you want?” </p>
    <p>He seems mildly surprised, as if people asking him for his opinion isn’t something that happens often. It probably isn’t, these days, unless it’s his mom asking what kind of chicken tenders he wants for lunch. </p>
    <p>“I dunno, Alex. It’s alright,” he says again, and I don’t know if he’s trying to say I don’t need to talk about it or trying to console me. Maybe he’s offended that he has to give advice to one of the people who wrecked his life.</p>
    <p>I wouldn’t blame him.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>July 24</b></p>
    <p>Phoebe called me again today. I was lying in bed, thinking too much, when my phone rang. Seeing her number is oddly comforting.</p>
    <p>“Hey,” she says. “Sorry, were you busy?”</p>
    <p>“Nope. Just thinking about everything.”</p>
    <p>“Okay. Me too, I guess.”</p>
    <p>There’s a long silence. Like always, I’m on the cusp of saying something, waiting for something to overflow inside my head to push it out of my mouth. But Phoebe, without much effort, breaks the silence first. “I can’t help wondering if it was partly my fault, some days. Like, the breakup was pretty bad. We were both angry at each other. I even forgot what it was about. I mean there were like a dozen things, but I don’t know if our relationship was over by the time most of them happened. Anyway. It sounds really, really self-aggrandizing, but what if he was still angry at me, and decided to take it out on everyone at the party?”</p>
    <p>“I kinda wonder the same thing, and honestly, I’m starting to realize that there was just nothing I could have done.” </p>
    <p>And when I tell her that, I finally start to actually believe it. Maybe it’s just my own tired self-defense mechanisms at work once again, but I feel like I’m blaming myself less and less for everything. Even though I wished for something to happen doesn’t mean it’s my fault.</p>
    <p>“Thanks for that, Alex.”</p>
    <p>I can hear Phoebe smiling at me, and it’s just like we were back in high school. I think about her smiling at me, but with her arm through Milo’s, and banish the image from my head. It’s not worth agonizing about anymore. Maybe it is. Maybe it was Milo I was jealous of this entire time because he got to date her. I don’t know. Should I tell her?</p>
    <p>“Hey, Alex, I actually have to go pick up Juno. Talk to you later?”</p>
    <p>“Oh, sure. Bye.”</p>
    <p>And she hangs up. I wish I had someone to be an older sibling to. Having someone to take care of must be nice.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>July 22</b></p>
    <p>I’ve been feeling like a sad sack of shit for too long. It’s time to go on a run, something I haven’t done since high school. I find my old running shoes, mud-flecked and dusty in my closet, and set out at a jog with my tendons creaking like the rigging of an old ship. I turn off my street into the forest trail, and see a girl’s bouncing ponytail fifty meters away. She was the one from the party. Phoebe? No.</p>
    <p>No, Phoenix. Should I catch up to her? I can’t run slowly and creepily behind her. She decides this for me, by noticing me and slowing down so I can catch up.</p>
    <p>“You’re Alex, right?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah,” I say, hoping she doesn’t notice how out of breath I am. It’s been too long.</p>
    <p>“Nice shoes,” she says, probably trying to avoid talking about Milo. “You also do cross country in high school?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, but I was more of a miler. You too, huh?”</p>
    <p>“Yep. Long-distance for the entire year.”</p>
    <p>It’s a cloudy day, with a chilly breeze coming off the mountains, and it’s perfect. The alpine air feels like a cleansing vapor,  like it’s rinsing our mental toxins out through our sinuses.</p>
    <p>Phoenix agrees. “Whenever I run, I feel so much less awkward. You saw how uncomfortable I was at the party. It’s like the exertion just burns everything else in my mind away.”</p>
    <p>“Maybe we all need something like that in our lives. I know I do.”</p>
    <p>And the more I think about it, the more I’m convinced there’s some substance to that point. Slight trauma can galvanize people, get them off their asses. Look at me, running for the first time in forever and actually striking up a conversation with somebody I just met.</p>
    <p>“Your friend Allie is pretty cool,” says Phoenix, ending the comfortable silence. Our steps echo as we thump over a small wooden footbridge. This is where Milo and I drank our first beers, I remember. I secretly poured most of mine into the stream below us since I didn’t like the taste.</p>
    <p>“You met her? I thought she was with Nick the entire time.”</p>
    <p>“I just talked to them both a little bit. Chark was getting too nervous and I kinda figured I’d just cut him loose and let him figure out nobody was going to give him shit for his name.”</p>
    <p>I ponder that. A crow caws in the distance.</p>
    <p>“No offense,” Phoenix continues, “but you were the only person there who did.”</p>
    <p>“Sorry. I guess I was a bit quick to judge.”</p>
    <p>“I get the sense you do that,” she says, without a hint of humor in her voice. My private laughter at Chark was more obvious than I thought. I shrug, and try to change the subject.</p>
    <p>“So you and Allie are friends now, huh? Has she played any weird jokes on you or anything?”</p>
    <p>“Oh yeah, the first time we talked she tried to convince me she and Nick were cursed or something. It’s fine, I have a few friends like that back home. Just gotta let them know where you stand on their bullshit.”</p>
    <p>I am quietly impressed. It took me a while to penetrate Allie’s weird standoffishness and become an actual friend of hers, and Phoenix managed it within a few weeks, even despite Allie’s increased weirdness to cope with Milo’s death. Maybe it actually opened up her cold, dead little heart. Dead for everyone besides Nick, for some reason.</p>
    <p>We keep going for a half-mile longer until Phoenix decides she should turn back. </p>
    <p>“What?” I say. “The weather’s perfect. I’m gonna keep going.”</p>
    <p>“That’s fine,” she says. “I fucked up my Achilles in high school and it comes back to haunt me sometimes. See you later, Alex. We should do this again sometime.”</p>
    <p>Knowing, and maybe hoping, we never will, I keep going up the hill and loop around the radio tower, having found a surprising amount of stamina and an equally surprising change of heart about things. From here, the valley seems peaceful, the town and everything artificial masked by the early-morning mist.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>July 20</b></p>
    <p>Josh and his parents are walking by my house. They’re talking, but it seems like Josh is trying too hard to mediate the conversation between his parents. I’m sitting on my roof, watching them through the trees separating my house from the street, and something about their body language suggests Josh is the main force holding them together, despite how pissed off they must be about everything.</p>
    <p>I’ve never really talked to Josh’s parents. From what I remember from high school, they always seemed a little distant, case in point their business trip over the weekend. They should’ve stayed here, and done their distant benevolent ghost routine like usual. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>July 19</b></p>
    <p>Got a text from some number that turned out to be Phoebe. She still had mine stored in her phone after all these years. She wanted to know what happened, and I didn’t say much. Just that Milo had died on the way home after the party. I didn’t tell her about Geg or anything, I don’t think she needs to hear it right now. I don’t even know why she called me if she’s going to sit there breathing into her phone. I guess she’s crying, or something, but I don’t know. Eventually, she says something, and it’s the question I least want to answer.</p>
    <p>“So did you guys talk much? At the party?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah. Well, a little. Nothing of substance, really.”</p>
    <p>“That figures. What about his friends, are they staying?”</p>
    <p>“For the summer? I think so, yeah. One of them has an internship or something here. They haven’t really reached out to us. They’re still mourning, I guess.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah. Uh. You doing alright, Alex? I know we haven’t talked much recently, but, you know. I just feel like I should start reaching out to people more now.”</p>
    <p>“I feel that. I guess I’ll unblock you guys on social media.”</p>
    <p>I can hear her mock-indignant huff through the phone. “I can’t believe you did that.”</p>
    <p>“What was I supposed to do? I didn’t want to stare at the proof of your relationship all the time. Not like I was jealous or anything, it was just one more thing from high school I kinda stopped caring about, you know?”</p>
    <p>“I’ve got some of those things too, dude. Kinda sucks, but what can you do, eh.”</p>
    <p>“Sure does.”</p>
    <p>After a bit more small talk, we hang up. I whitelist Milo’s profile, but when I go to look at his page to catch up on everything, it’s blank.</p>
    <p>At some point, he had blocked me too.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>July 4</b></p>
    <p>A bunch of us met on the hill by the radio tower to sit and watch the fireworks. There’s an open meadow with some rusted benches near the top, but it’s off the main trail behind a bunch of trees. It’s been the go-to spot of Milo and mine for years, and it feels vaguely blasphemous to invite everyone else there. But then again, it’s definitely time to open up a bit, and it’s not like the entire group of people is here. Nathan and Mary aren’t into the whole fourth of July thing, and are probably hanging out in one of their respective basements. And if I remember correctly from last year, Geg’s mom is convinced the radio tower is gonna give him cancer, so he’s also gonna be at home. Other people are late, so it’s just me, Josh, and Nick and Allie. Chark and Phoenix are a little ways up the hill, talking and sharing shitty light beer. </p>
    <p>I want to ask if they’re in a relationship, but I’m not completely sure Chark is straight. I don’t want to be a dick and say it upfront, though. Unfortunately, the only person who knows the most about them is dead. I don’t even know why they’re still in this town.</p>
    <p>I ask Josh, because he probably knows, and he says one of them has an internship at the Facebook data center here, which came with money for housing. Makes sense, but still, it’s a weird situation. The only link between our friend groups has been severed, and they’re still here. I wonder how the rest of the summer is gonna play out, if they’re gonna make any unlikely friendships or just stay isolated in their little social bubble.</p>
    <p>“Kind of a weird time for fireworks,” says Josh, as a large green one explodes in the sky. “With the funeral and all. Poor Milo.” He crumples his beer can and gently places it in the plastic bag by his feet.</p>
    <p>“Mmm,” says Nick. “I dunno. I might be in the minority here, but I was never a huge fan of Milo.”</p>
    <p>“Hey,” says Josh. “Show a little respect.”</p>
    <p>“I am. More than you, maybe. I don’t like the idea of deifying somebody after their death. You still gotta see them realistically.”</p>
    <p>“Why weren’t you a fan of him, then?” I ask.</p>
    <p>“Like, if I die,” says Nick, ignoring me, “I wouldn’t want people remembering some PG-rated fake version of myself. I think it’d be disingenuous to pretend I was some other kind of person.”</p>
    <p>“That may or may not be true,” Josh replies, eyes glowing in the light of an especially bright starburst, “but you can still let people mourn without jumping in and saying, ‘Hey, you guys remember the time Milo did that one shitty thing? Let’s think about that now, instead.’”</p>
    <p>“I think—” starts Allie, and stops as the sound of the explosion hits us. “I think you’d need the complete picture to have an accurate opinion of the person. Otherwise you would just be worshipping, or dunking on, or whatever, an idea.”</p>
    <p>“Well, technically,” I interject, “we’re always just referring to our own perceptions of people. They’ll never be completely accurate, and differ from person to person.”</p>
    <p>Allie frowns in the dim light. “Keep your pseudo-ivy-league-ass bullshit out of this. You know what I mean.” I do know what she means, but I don’t have anything else to contribute to this conversation.</p>
    <p>“My point is,” says Nick, “there’s a lot we don’t know about Milo. Even though we’ve known him for years. Like the whole Geg thing. What’s up with that?”</p>
    <p>I turn to look at Josh, to see his reaction. He stiffens a little, but nobody else seems to notice. He doesn’t answer, so I step in.</p>
    <p>“What do you mean, the whole Geg thing?”</p>
    <p>“Right when his Aluminum Phase started, Geg fucking hated Milo for some reason. He’s been avoiding him ever since sixth grade. Josh too, I think,” and Nick looks over at Josh as well. The wonder boy's face is in shadow. Where are some fireworks when you need them.</p>
    <p>Should I tell them? Is it worth, as Nick said, getting the complete picture? I don’t particularly feel like dealing with the emotional fallout right now on top of everything else.</p>
    <p>“Let’s just watch the fireworks,” Josh says coldly.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>June 24</b></p>
    <p>Milo’s funeral.</p>
    <p>We’re all feeling pretty numb. I know I am, at least. Everyone’s wearing nice clothes. That’s the thing I keep coming back to, despite everything. I’ve never seen my friends dressed this well before. Chark’s blue hair is very nicely combed. Phoenix’s eyes are a little red, but she’s more stoic than I imagined her being. Nick and Allie are still standing a foot apart, hands behind their backs. Geg is here somewhere, I think. </p>
    <p>Nathan and Mary told me privately that they weren’t coming, citing general emotional distress. Whatever their reason was, I told them it was fine, we all react differently, etc. But I wish they had come. </p>
    <p>Josh is already talking, but it’s not worth paying attention to. He’s probably just saying something eloquent, yet emotional. With just enough feeling breaking through the restraint of a pre-written monologue, and no proselytizing about drunk driving. He’s a natural public speaker, even though he was only on debate for a month before quitting to do water polo. I wonder if any of his speech is motivated by what he did to Geg. Maybe he’s just pushed it back into his head, like Milo. This is probably only a new turn of events for me. </p>
    <p>He’s finishing up. Should I say something? Maybe? I was the closest one to him, and it was kinda my fault. I guess I should. Not mention any of the ugly shit, obviously. </p>
    <p>“Uh. I think everyone who knew Milo and me back in middle school knew we were pretty close. Inseparable. And it’s because on the whole, he was a good person. I know none of us were perfect, but he really tried.”</p>
    <p>Keyword tried, but nobody else knows that. I’m his Geg. I don’t need to humanize him, but I do it anyway. Everyone thinks it was my fault for giving him the keys. Maybe it’s some posthumous form of Milo’s self-preservation instinct, a twisted black tree growing out of his grave and reaching into my head.</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry. I know I’ve apologized a million times, but sometimes I just can’t help wishing I could have done something different. And I know we all do, and we all will. I know how profoundly it’s affected all of us...”</p>
    <p>Out of the corner of my eye, I see Josh’s lips tighten.</p>
    <p>“But we’re going to have to just go on. Be the best we can be. Look out for each other.”</p>
    <p>If only I’d looked out for him. If only I hadn’t let my pettiness and my anger cloud my humanity, and listened to the one sober part of my brain that told me it was wrong. I don’t know how to end my speech. I don’t even know what I’m saying anymore. Josh gently interrupts me.</p>
    <p>“Thanks, Alex.”</p>
    <p>Thanks, Josh.</p>
    <p>I was the last one to talk. We all linger, say our goodbyes, maybe talk to Milo’s parents for a bit or at least give them a sorrowful look to let them know we care.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>June 22</b></p>
    <p>I got a call from Josh this morning. He just wants to talk about things, and seeing as how we’re all a little mentally worse for wear, I decided to humor him. He said he’d be on the end of the old bridge, but I parked my car a ways away. I didn’t want to disturb the mood, I guess. Josh was sitting on a tree stump with his back turned. As I approached, I noticed he was throwing stones into the slow river. </p>
    <p>I had stopped a little ways before reaching him, so I could lean on the bridge. He hadn’t turned around to face me, even though I think he heard my car, so maybe he was crying or something. Either way, I’m keeping my distance.</p>
    <p>“Crazy night, huh,” says Josh. He grunts as he throws a stone into the slow river. The early-morning mist is muffling everything, even the splash. It’s just us, and the occasional noise that might be quiet sniffling or just the wind coming off the mountains.</p>
    <p>“Yeah.” </p>
    <p>What else can I say? Isn’t this just one of those times where you have to let people get whatever it is off their chest? I barely know what I’m feeling, let alone Josh, who I haven’t had a serious conversation with since high school.</p>
    <p>“I still can’t believe it.” He throws another rock, and it vanishes into the mist. “Part of me wants to blame myself, I shouldn’t have given you his keys. But then Chark shouldn’t have hidden them, or should have stayed sober. What a fucking mess. Jesus.”</p>
    <p>I choose to remain silent. I’ve heard that helps in some situations, just lets people talk about whatever’s on their mind.</p>
    <p>“And I think my dad’s gonna kill me. He’s been just weirdly cold and distant lately, and I dunno what’s happening. Like, my mom is trying to be all nice and stuff, but the only reason they went on that trip recently is that they’ve been making a bit of an effort to get closer together. And now what, I have a party when they’re gone, like some asshole, and they have to get back and deal with all this shit? Fuck!”</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry, Josh,” I say, as gently as I can without sounding too patronizing.</p>
    <p>“I guess you must need some space too. Sorry for dumping all this on you.”</p>
    <p>Do I need space? I don’t know what I need. I need this to not be happening.</p>
    <p>“Okay, you know what pisses me off, in this stupid petty way?” says Josh. “Everyone who doesn’t know me very well thinks I’m this frat-bro asshole as soon as they meet me. And now what? ‘Oh yeah, Josh, the guy who threw the party where Milo died!’ That’s gonna be my legacy! It’s not even supposed to be about me, but I’m still making it about me. God dammit.”</p>
    <p>His head sinks into his arms. I think he’s out of rocks, but I can’t tell from where I am.</p>
    <p>Neither of us say anything. After a while, I walk back across the bridge.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>June 20</b></p>
    <p>I’ve been back home all of 24 hours and I’m already at a party. Like I haven’t already partied enough this year. Maybe more than I actually wanted to, but at least I survived freshman year of college. That’s something.</p>
    <p>Josh is hosting. His parents are out of town and his abuela is out playing bingo, so being the magnanimous Good Guy he is, he decided to get everyone we knew from high school together. Which, because we had a lot of finicky friend groups in high school, isn’t that many people. The party seemed louder when I was walking up to the front door. </p>
    <p>I make a beeline straight for the first people I see to avoid standing awkwardly in the entryway: Nick and Allie. They’re standing in the corner of Josh’s living room, facing slightly away from each other so nobody could possibly think their secret half-relationship exists. Allie, the blasée ex-cross-country runner, takes a lighter out of her hoodie, flicks it briefly, and then stows it in the pocket of her track pants. Nick is looking at his boots, like he stepped in something, but stops as I approach.</p>
    <p>“Alex!” </p>
    <p>Allie is the first to greet me, followed somewhat less enthusiastically by Nick (like usual) and she gives me an awkward hug. I return it with a few pats on the back. Maybe she’s had a few drinks, because she’s usually never been this friendly to me. Her cheeks are flushed like I remember them getting.</p>
    <p>We say hello in the longer form, make small talk about our respective freshman years (it’s good, a little stressful, freshman fifteen, I threw up fourteen times first semester, etc) until I finally decide to take the conversation somewhere else. I ask Nick about his shoe, and he explains that he stepped on a frog.</p>
    <p>“He murdered it,” interjects Allie, and Nick glares at her.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t. It was dark and you left me behind in the fucking woods.”</p>
    <p>“We’re cursed,” said Allie. “That frog died because we made out yesterday. Next time, it’s gonna be a person who dies.”</p>
    <p>I laugh uncomfortably, an art I’ve perfected, and excuse myself to another room of the house, to find a drink and another conversation. As I leave, I hear them go back to making fun of Josh’s attempts at art. We all have something we’re good at, something that makes us feel better than everyone else, but in Josh’s case, art is the one thing he’s not good at. His parents hang the sketches and occasional watercolor on his wall anyway, like they know it’s the one thing he can’t be the best at and want the rest of us to feel a little more at ease around him. It works, sort of.</p>
    <p>Josh, texting and walking, almost bumps into me as I sidle past him.</p>
    <p>“Hey, Alex! When did you get here, homie? How’s life?”</p>
    <p>“Life is okay, I—”</p>
    <p>“I know we didn’t talk much during the year, but I hope you’ve been doing alright. College is pretty crazy, huh?”</p>
    <p>Josh, who is a fan of interrupting people with banalities, wanted to stay in contact with everyone. It’s admirable, but the inevitability of life will tear apart everything over long-distance. Friendships, relationships. Especially relationships.</p>
    <p>“College is pretty crazy. How’s your art going?”</p>
    <p>“Terribly. Hey, are these your keys? I found them in the bathtub, I think Geg was trying to eat them. You know how he is.”</p>
    <p>Josh holds out a set of keys. They have a blue 20-sided die dangling from them.</p>
    <p>“No,” I say, taking them, “but I’ll find who they belong to.”</p>
    <p>So Milo’s here somewhere. I feel ill already. I haven’t talked to him since the middle of the first semester. I don’t remember which of us didn't text back, but I think after he and Phoebe started dating, any mutual desire to stay connected dried up. Of course, because Phoebe is a photographer, and they went to the same school, I was bombarded with the beautifully-composed proof of their beautiful relationship until I blocked her and Milo on every form of social media. </p>
    <p>Maybe our loss of contact was for the best. I ended up going to a better college than he did and I feel like we’re moving in different circles these days. Still though, I have no idea what to say to him if I’m the one to give him his keys. He probably thinks I’m some kind of elitist now.</p>
    <p>I wander over to two new people, a guy and a girl. Friends of friends. The guy has a pink shirt, muscles, and blue hair. I thought I left the pink polos behind when I left school for the summer, but at least his hair is interesting. The girl has freckles and a slightly worried expression. They seem easy to talk to, but I don’t even have to introduce myself.</p>
    <p>“Are you Alex?” The girl sticks her hand out, a rigid, clearly agonized-over gesture. It looks like she bites her nails. “I’m Phoenix.”</p>
    <p>I want to tell her it’s a pretty name because it reminds me of a girl I knew from high school, but she’s out of my life and is probably still dating Milo.</p>
    <p>“Yeah, hey. Are you guys friends of...?”</p>
    <p>“Milo,” says the guy. “He’s here somewhere, I think. We just came along with him.” </p>
    <p>I wonder if they had fun, driving around town in the same car Milo and I used to hang out in all throughout high school. I hope they did. Maybe the guy senses my discomfort, or maybe he’s just awkward, but he seems visibly uncomfortable at the prospect of introducing himself. I wonder what Milo told them about me. Maybe they’re just feigning nice. Struck by a burst of mild sadism, I decide to push things.</p>
    <p>“Sorry, what’s your name?”</p>
    <p>“Chark.”</p>
    <p>Chark. What kind of terrible white trash parent would name their kid Chark? Jesus, this guy must have been bullied since elementary school. No wonder he’s been trying to call attention to himself in other ways.</p>
    <p>“Wow, that’s a, uh, interesting name,” I say, after staring at him and maybe for smirking slightly too long.</p>
    <p>Chark takes a long, slow drink of whatever’s in his cup, and grimaces.</p>
    <p>“Yeah. My sister is named Kiffany. My mother, Denantha, wanted unique names for us, and my dad just didn’t want to disagree. Or something.”</p>
    <p>“Come on,” says Phoenix, “Chark is a cute name! It’s like the sexy baby of Charles and Mark!”</p>
    <p>“Nooo,” Chark moans. “Come on, take a shot with me. You too, Alex.”</p>
    <p>I oblige, but Phoenix hesitates.</p>
    <p>“Wait, you had to drive Milo home.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, but I hid his keys somewhere. Bathroom, I think. It’s fine.”</p>
    <p>I leave them to drink and drift away, snagging a drink of my own and moving through the rest of Josh’s house.</p>
    <p>“Alex!” echoes a nasal voice from the bathroom. It’s Geg, sitting on the carpet and slouching against the bathtub. Like many people here, I haven’t thought about him since high school. I don’t even know if he’s gone to college, but he somehow found his way here. Josh would have invited him, being the nice guy and everything. I guess it’s my turn to be the nice one and spend some time with him.</p>
    <p>“What are you doing in the bathroom, Geg?”</p>
    <p>“Just chillin’! Do you have keys?”</p>
    <p>I know Geg means well, but he’s just so completely weird that it’s hard to have a lengthy conversation with him. Maybe we should stop butchering his name, but to be fair, he’s been butchering his own name since he screwed up his mouth by trying to eat a soda can during his Aluminum Phase.</p>
    <p>“Keys? Like, piano keys?”</p>
    <p>“The keys. You know. Bathtub keys. Chark’s keys.”</p>
    <p>“Okay, I’m a bit drunk, but I definitely saw Chark use his keys to shotgun a beer a few minutes ago. I don’t know whose keys you saw, Geg, but they’re not Chark’s.”</p>
    <p>“‘S not ‘Geg’. I’m Geg.”</p>
    <p>“Alright, Geg. I’m gonna keep walking. See you around.”</p>
    <p> I follow the sounds of video games and frantic button-clicking, where I find Nathan and Mary on a couch. They’re the couple that has never been a couple, and they exist only to one-up each other.</p>
    <p>As I enter the room, the sounds coming from the TV suddenly change.</p>
    <p>“Aaah!” Nathan yells, throwing up the controller and slumping across the couch, in the opposite direction of Mary. It seems calculated, but that might just be me.</p>
    <p>“You like that, little man?” she says, and he groans something about a broken recovery. They start a rematch. Mary looks behind her and notices me. “Alex, how long have you been there?”</p>
    <p>“Not long.”</p>
    <p>“Did you know Milo’s here? Why didn’t you come with him, he got here like an hour ago!”</p>
    <p>Good question, Mary. Let’s let Nathan frantically field this one.</p>
    <p>“Uh, remember? The Phoebe thing?”</p>
    <p>Mary apologizes profusely, but I can tell she and Nathan still look down a bit on the puny romantic diversions of mortals. These two have ascended to the realm of Japanese fighting games from the early 2000s. </p>
    <p>They unpause and keep playing. I really want to join them, but I’m afraid I’ll be rusty. They’d never laugh at me, but still.</p>
    <p>“Do you ever get tired of playing this?” says Nathan, after another loss.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know, Nathan, do you ever get tired of being absolute garbage?”</p>
    <p>Maybe I’ll just leave them alone. I point myself in the direction of the drinks and start walking. I haven’t really had a genuine conversation with anyone here yet. To be fair, I’ve only been at this party for less than an hour, but I used to feel so close to everyone here in high school. Even if it was a nightmare of barely-overlapping cliques, at least we were all on friendly terms with each other, and knew each other. I guess I was right, that distance just forces all of us to drift apart.</p>
    <p>I’m in Josh’s room now, looking at his art. He was right, it’s terrible. At least he still has his music posters up. He has good taste in those. </p>
    <p>“Hey, Alex,” says a skinny, fashionable figure behind me, and I almost spill my drink all over Josh’s desk.</p>
    <p>“Oh, hey.” Like it’s a surprise that Milo is here, like that keychain with a sparkling shard of our childhood D&D games isn’t currently burning a hole in my pocket. I should have gotten rid of the keys, maybe given them to Chark or something. He was supposed to be Milo’s ride.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a while,” he says, with forced nonchalance. At least, I think it’s forced.</p>
    <p>“It sure has,” I say, trying to remember which of us broke contact first. It was him, I think. I don’t think I would.</p>
    <p>“Look, I don’t know if you’re still mad about Phoebe—”</p>
    <p>Yes, but it’s only one of the reasons I resent him.</p>
    <p>“But we broke up a while ago. Like halfway through the first semester. I was gonna tell you, but you blocked me.”</p>
    <p>Like it was my fault.</p>
    <p>“I think she’s dating some girl again. Maybe I turned her off guys altogether.”</p>
    <p>“That’s not a thing,” I say, trying not to smile. He’s a funny guy, if you can convince him to put any emotional effort into your interactions.</p>
    <p>Milo shrugs and takes another drink, eyes downcast. “Maybe she’ll wind up dating Geg.”</p>
    <p>“Oh god. Wait, does Geg even go to college?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah,” said Milo, “he’s in one of my classes. I barely see him outside of that, though. He doesn’t like me, obviously.”</p>
    <p>“I mean, I butcher his name and everything, but he still seems to like me.”</p>
    <p>“No, you know. Because of what Josh and I did in sixth grade.”</p>
    <p>“What?”</p>
    <p>“I told you. Right?”</p>
    <p>Milo is suddenly looking cagey, even through his buzz.</p>
    <p>“What, did you guys start his Aluminum Phase or something?”</p>
    <p>“No. Well, kinda. We just tripped him once. Like, all three of us were just messing around, but when he fell, he fucked up his teeth pretty badly. So naturally Josh and I panicked, and we made him swear never to tell anyone.”</p>
    <p>“Wait, so did he ever eat those cans and shit or not?”</p>
    <p>“No, he did. But we think it was so we wouldn’t get in trouble. I don’t know.”</p>
    <p>“So we’ve been butchering his name and treating him like some sort of leper all along, and it’s your fault? What the fuck?”</p>
    <p>“No! Josh helped. Also, why is it only okay if it’s his fault?” Milo glared at me, red-faced. “Suddenly since Josh and I accidentally did something six years ago you get to act all high and mighty? Don’t try to absolve yourself of, of blame by just shitting on me! You perpetuated it just as much as the rest of us.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t turn this on me! Jesus Christ, did Phoebe know?”</p>
    <p>Milo shrugs. “I never told her. We haven’t talked since we broke up. She blocked me on everything.”</p>
    <p>“Maybe she was right to. You’re a piece of shit.”</p>
    <p>Milo’s face contorts. I’ve never seen him this angry. I don’t regret saying it, even though I know I’m not without blame. I try to drop my drink, because I know he’s going to push me, but I barely manage. The bottle shatters on Josh’s floor and I stagger against the wall.</p>
    <p>“I tried to make amends, alright?” says Milo, holding my shoulders like he’s chastising a child. “I tried to treat him like a normal person, but it was too late. Everyone found his new speech impediment hilarious, including you. ”</p>
    <p>“Get off me,” I say, and throw him to the side, but he grabs my shirt. We land on the floor together and struggle. I’m sober enough to avoid the glass, but Milo doesn’t care. His thrashing elbow looks like it’s been through a cheese grater, but he manages to pin me down for a second. His breath is hot and alcoholic on my face. In my struggle to get away, the keychain falls out of my pocket and rolls across the floor. We both freeze.</p>
    <p>Milo is close enough to kiss me, close enough that I can watch the tiny blue dot in his eyes as it skitters across the floor and comes to rest on a 1.</p>
    <p>A critical failure. If we were six years younger we would have been laughing as our characters hilariously, often fatally failed at whatever we had set them to do. But now, I just feel exhausted. I think I’m sobering up. </p>
    <p>“Why the fuck do you have my keys?” asks Milo.</p>
    <p>“Uh, Chark gave them to me.”</p>
    <p>I slap my hand over them, over the keys and broken glass, a second before Milo does. I never thought beating him in that stupid card game in high school would come in this handy. He slams my hand against the carpet, grinding shards into my palm, but it doesn’t matter. He’s off balance now, and I manage to get out from under him and on my feet. </p>
    <p>“I want to go home,” Milo says. “Give me my keys.”</p>
    <p>I curl my fist around the spikes of glass and metal, shake my head and, still staring at him, start backing out of the door. Into the party where there are eyes and light and other people.</p>
    <p>“Prom night,” says Milo, swaying slightly. </p>
    <p>My face turns red and I stop walking. </p>
    <p>“Yeah,” he says. “I’m not the only one still keeping secrets, you pervert.”</p>
    <p>“We swore we wouldn’t tell anyone. But also, we were drunk, so who cares?”</p>
    <p>“Well, sure,” Milo concedes, “I wouldn’t tell anyone the version where we were both drunk. Just that I was, and that you wouldn’t take no for an answer.”</p>
    <p>And everyone would believe him. They don’t know the truth about Geg. Milo has known everyone for years longer and he would execute this story swiftly and decisively. I wouldn’t stand a chance. I’d become just like Geg, and be trapped in this fucking town with everybody knowing for the rest of the summer.</p>
    <p>“Fine. Take your fucking keys,” I say, and drop the now-bloody things on the floor. Milo picks them up with an angry stumble and shoulders past me, knocking over Josh’s lamp on the way out.
