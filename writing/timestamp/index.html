    <p>﻿I’ve been back home all of 24 hours and I’m already at a party. Like I haven’t already partied enough this year. Maybe more than I actually wanted to, but at least I survived freshman year of college. That’s something.</p>
<p>Josh is hosting. His parents are out of town and his abuela is out playing bingo, so being the magnanimous Good Guy he is, he decided to get everyone we knew from high school together. Which, because we had a lot of finicky friend groups in high school, isn’t that many people. The party seemed louder when I was walking up to the front door.</p>
<p>I make a beeline straight for the first people I see to avoid standing awkwardly in the entryway: Nick and Allie. They’re standing in the corner of Josh’s living room, facing slightly away from each other so nobody could possibly think their secret half-relationship exists. Allie, the blasée ex-cross-country runner, takes a lighter out of her hoodie, flicks it briefly, and then stows it in the pocket of her track pants. Nick is looking at his boots, like he stepped in something, but stops as I approach.</p>
<p>“Alex!”</p>
<p>Allie is the first to greet me, followed somewhat less enthusiastically by Nick (like usual) and she gives me an awkward hug. I return it with a few pats on the back. Maybe she’s had a few drinks, because she’s usually never been this friendly to me. Her cheeks are flushed like I remember them getting.</p>
<p>We say hello in the longer form, make small talk about our respective freshman years (it’s good, a little stressful, freshman fifteen, I threw up fourteen times first semester, etc) until I finally decide to take the conversation somewhere else. I ask Nick about his shoe, and he explains that he stepped on a frog.</p>
<p>“He murdered it,” interjects Allie, and Nick glares at her.</p>
<p>“I didn’t. It was dark and you left me behind in the fucking woods.”</p>
<p>“We’re cursed,” said Allie. “That frog died because we made out yesterday. Next time, it’s gonna be a person who dies.”</p>
<p>I laugh uncomfortably, an art I’ve perfected, and excuse myself to another room of the house, to find a drink and another conversation. As I leave, I hear them go back to making fun of Josh’s attempts at art. We all have something we're good at, something that makes us feel better than everyone else, but in Josh’s case, art is the one thing he has never quite managed to grasp. His parents hang the sketches and occasional watercolor on his wall anyway, like they know it’s the one thing he can’t be the best at and want the rest of us to feel a little more at ease around him. It works, sort of.</p>
<p>Josh, texting and walking, almost bumps into me as I sidle past him.</p>
<p>“Hey, Alex! When did you get here, bro? How’s life?”</p>
<p>“Life is okay, I—”</p>
<p>“I know we didn’t talk much during the year, but I hope you’ve been doing alright. College is pretty crazy, huh?”</p>
<p>Josh, who is a fan of interrupting people with banalities, wanted to stay in contact with everyone. It’s admirable, but the inevitability of life will tear apart everything over long-distance. Friendships, relationships. Especially relationships.</p>
<p>“College is pretty crazy. How’s your art going?”</p>
<p>“Terribly. Hey, are these your keys? I found them in the bathtub, I think Geg was trying to eat them. You know how he is.”</p>
<p>Josh holds out a set of keys. They have a blue 20-sided die dangling from them.</p>
<p>“No,” I say, taking them, “but I’ll find who they belong to.”</p>
<p>So Milo’s here somewhere. I feel ill already. I haven’t talked to him since the middle of first semester. I don’t remember which of us was didn’t text back, but I think after he and Phoebe started dating any desire to stay connected dried up. Of course, because Phoebe is a photographer, and they went to the same school, I was bombarded with the beautifully-composed proof of their beautiful relationship until I blocked her and Milo on every form of social media.</p>
<p>Maybe our loss of contact was for the best. I ended up going to a better college than he did and I feel like we’re moving in different circles these days. Still though, I have no idea what to say to him if I’m the one to give him his keys. He probably thinks I’m some kind of elitist now.</p>
<p>I wander over to two new people, a guy and a girl. Friends of friends. The guy has a pink shirt, muscles, and blue hair. I thought I left the pink polos behind when I left school for the summer, but at least his hair is interesting. The girl has freckles and a slightly worried expression. They seem easy to talk to, but I don’t even have to introduce myself.</p>
<p>“Are you Alex?” The girl sticks her hand out, a rigid, clearly agonized-over gesture. It looks like she bites her nails. “I’m Phoenix.”</p>
<p>I want to tell her it’s a pretty name because it reminds me of a girl I knew from high school, but she’s out of my life and is probably still dating Milo.</p>
<p>“Yeah, hey. Are you guys friends of...?”</p>
<p>“Milo,” says the guy. “He’s here somewhere, I think. We just came along with him.”</p>
<p>I wonder if they had fun, driving around town in the same car Milo and I used to hang out in all throughout high school. I hope they did. Maybe the guy senses my discomfort, or maybe he’s just awkward, but he seems visibly uncomfortable at the prospect of introducing himself. I wonder what Milo told them about me. Maybe they’re just feigning nice. Struck by a burst of mild sadism, I decide to push things.</p>
<p>“Sorry, what’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Chark.”</p>
<p>Chark. What kind of terrible white trash parent would name their kid Chark? Jesus, this guy must have been bullied since elementary school. No wonder he’s been trying to call attention to himself in other ways.</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s a, uh, interesting name,” I say, after staring at him and maybe for smirking slightly too long.</p>
<p>Chark takes a long, slow drink of whatever’s in his cup, and grimaces.</p>
<p>“Yeah. My sister is named Kiffany. My mother, Denantha, wanted unique names for us, and my dad just didn’t want to disagree. Or something.”</p>
<p>“Come on,” says Phoenix, “Chark is a cute name! It’s like the sexy baby of Charles and Mark!”</p>
<p>“Nooo,” Chark moans. “Come on, take a shot with me. You too, Alex.”</p>
<p>I oblige, but Phoenix hesitates.</p>
<p>“Wait, you had to drive Milo home.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but I hid his keys somewhere. Bathroom, I think. It’s fine.”</p>
<p>I leave her to drink with him and drift away, snagging a drink and moving through the rest of Josh’s house.</p>
<p>“Alex!” echoes a nasal voice from the bathroom. It’s Geg, sitting on the carpet and slouching against the bathtub. Like many people here, I haven’t thought about him since high school. I don’t even know if he’s gone to college, but he somehow found his way here. Josh would have invited him, being the nice guy and everything. I guess it’s my turn to be the nice one and spend some time with him.</p>
<p>“What are you doing in the bathroom, Geg?”</p>
<p>“Just chillin’! Do you have keys?”</p>
<p>I know Geg means well, but he’s just so completely weird that it’s hard to have a lengthy conversation with him. Maybe we should stop butchering his name, but to be fair, he’s been butchering his own name since he screwed up his mouth by trying to eat a soda can during his Aluminum Phase.</p>
<p>“Keys? Like, any keys?”</p>
<p>“The keys. You know. Bathtub keys. Chark’s keys.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I’m a bit drunk, but I definitely saw Chark use his keys to shotgun a beer a few minutes ago. I don’t know whose keys you saw, Geg, but they’re not Chark’s.”</p>
<p>“‘S not ‘Geg’. I’m<em>Geg</em>.”</p>
<p>“Alright, Geg. I’m gonna keep walking. See you around.”</p>
<p>I follow the sounds of video games and frantic button-clicking, where I find Nathan and Mary on a couch. They’re the couple that has never been a couple, and they exist only to one-up each other.</p>
<p>As I enter the room, the sounds coming from the TV suddenly change.</p>
<p>“Aaah!” Nathan yells, throwing up the controller and slumping across the couch, in the opposite direction of Mary. It seems calculated, but that might just be me.</p>
<p>“You like that, little man?” she says, and he groans something about a broken recovery. They start a rematch. Mary looks behind her and notices me. “Alex, how long have you been there?”</p>
<p>“Not long.”</p>
<p>“Did you know Milo’s here? Why didn’t you come with him, he got here like an hour ago!”</p>
<p>Good question, Mary. Let’s let Nathan frantically field this one.</p>
<p>“Uh, remember? The Phoebe thing?”</p>
<p>Mary apologizes profusely, but I can tell she and Nathan still look down a bit on the puny romantic diversions of mortals. These two have ascended to the realm of Japanese fighting games from the early 2000s.</p>
<p>They unpause and keep playing. I really want to join them, but I’m afraid I’ll be rusty. They’d never laugh at me, but still.</p>
<p>“Do you ever get tired of playing this?” says Nathan, after another loss.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Nathan, do you ever get tired of being absolute garbage?”</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll just leave them alone. I point myself in the direction of the drinks and start walking. I haven’t really had a genuine conversation with anyone here yet. To be fair, I’ve only been at this party for less than an hour, but I used to feel so close to everyone here in high school. Even if it was a nightmare of barely-overlapping cliques, at least we were all on friendly terms with each other, and knew each other. I guess I was right, that distance just forces all of us to drift apart.</p>
<p>I’m in Josh’s room now, looking at his art. He was right, it’s terrible. At least he still has his music posters up. He has good taste in those.</p>
<p>“Hey, Alex,” says a skinny, fashionable figure behind me, and I almost spill my drink all over Josh’s desk.</p>
<p>“Oh, hey.” Like it’s a surprise that Milo is here, like that keychain with a sparkling shard of our childhood Dungeons and Dragons games isn’t currently burning a hole in my pocket. I should have gotten rid of the keys, maybe given them to Chark or something. He was supposed to be Milo’s ride.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while,” he says, with forced nonchalance. At least, I think it’s forced.</p>
<p>“It sure has,” I say, trying to remember which of us broke contact first. It was him, I think. I don’t think I would.</p>
<p>“Look, I don’t know if you’re still mad about Phoebe—”</p>
<p>I am, but it’s only one of the reasons I resent him.</p>
<p>“But we broke up a while ago. Like halfway through first semester. I was gonna tell you, but you blocked me.”</p>
<p>Like it was my fault.</p>
<p>“I think she’s dating some girl again. Maybe I turned her off guys altogether.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a thing,” I say, trying not to smile. He’s a funny guy, if you can convince him to put any emotional effort into your interactions.</p>
<p>Milo shrugs and takes another drink, eyes downcast. “Maybe she’ll wind up dating Geg.”</p>
<p>“Oh god. Wait, does Geg even go to college?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Milo, “he’s in one of my classes. I barely see him outside of that, though. He doesn’t like me, obviously.”</p>
<p>“I mean, I butcher his name and everything, but he still seems to like me.”</p>
<p>“No, you know. Because of what Josh and I did in sixth grade.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I told you. Right?”</p>
<p>Milo is suddenly looking cagey, even through his buzz.</p>
<p>“What, did you guys start his Aluminum Phase or something?”</p>
<p>“No. Well, kinda. We just tripped him once. Like, all three of us were just messing around, but when he fell, he fucked up his teeth pretty badly. So naturally Josh and I panicked, and we made him swear never to tell anyone.”</p>
<p>“Wait, so did he ever eat those cans and shit or not?”</p>
<p>“No, he did. But we think it was so we wouldn’t get in trouble. I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“So we’ve been butchering his name and treating him like some sort of leper all along, and it’s your fault? What the fuck?”</p>
<p>“No! Josh helped. Also, why is it only okay if it’s his fault?” Milo glared at me, red-faced. “Suddenly since Josh and I accidentally did something six years ago you get to act all high and mighty?”</p>
<p>“Don’t turn this on me! Jesus Christ, did Phoebe know?”</p>
<p>Milo shrugs. “I never told her. We haven’t talked since we broke up. She blocked me on everything.”</p>
<p>“Maybe she was right to. You’re a piece of shit.”</p>
<p>I’ve never seen Milo this angry. I don’t regret saying it, even though I know I’m not without blame. I try to drop my drink, because I know he’s going to push me, but I barely manage. His bottle shatters on Josh’s floor and I stagger against the wall.</p>
<p>“I tried to make amends, alright?” says Milo, holding my shoulders like he’s chastising a child. “I tried to treat him like a normal person, but it was too late. Everyone found his new speech impediment hilarious, including you. ”</p>
<p>“Get off me,” I say, and throw him to the side, but he grabs my shirt. We land on the floor together and struggle. I’m sober enough to avoid the glass, but Milo doesn’t care. His thrashing elbow looks like it’s been through a cheese grater, but he manages to pin me down for a second. His breath is hot and alcoholic on my face. In my struggle to get away, the keychain falls out of my pocket and rolls across the floor. We both freeze.</p>
<p>Milo is close enough to kiss me, close enough that I can watch the tiny blue dot in his eyes as it skitters across the floor and comes to rest on a 1.</p>
<p>A critical failure. If we were six years younger we would have been laughing as our characters hilariously, often fatally failed at whatever we had set them to do. But now, I just feel exhausted. I think I’m sobering up.</p>
<p>“Why the fuck do you have my keys?” asks Milo.</p>
<p>“Uh, Chark gave them to me.”</p>
<p>I slap my hand over them, over the keys and broken glass, a second before Milo does. I never thought beating him in that stupid card game in high school would come in this handy. He crushes my hand against the carpet, grinding shards into my palm, but it doesn’t matter. He’s off balance now, and I manage to get out from under him and on my feet.</p>
<p>“I want to go home,” Milo says. “Give me my keys.”</p>
<p>I curl my fist around the glass and metal, shake my head and, still staring at him, start backing out of the door. Into the party where there are eyes and light and other people.</p>
<p>“Prom night,” says Milo, swaying slightly.</p>
<p>My face turns red and I stop walking.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he says. “I’m not the only one still keeping secrets, you pervert.”</p>
<p>“We swore we wouldn’t tell anyone. But also, we were drunk, so who cares?”</p>
<p>“Well, sure,” Milo concedes, “I wouldn’t tell anyone the version where we were both drunk. Just that I was, and that you wouldn’t take no for an answer.”</p>
<p>And everyone would believe him. They don’t know the truth about Geg. Milo has known everyone for years longer and he would execute this story swiftly and decisively. I wouldn’t stand a chance. I’d become just like Geg, and be trapped in this fucking town with everybody knowing for the rest of the summer.</p>
<p>“Fine. Take your keys,” I say, and drop the now-bloody things on the floor. Milo picks them up with an angry stumble and shoulders past me.</p>
<p>I hope he dies on the way home.</p>
