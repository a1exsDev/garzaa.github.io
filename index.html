			<h1>Adrian Garza</h1>
			<p>
				Howdy. I just graduated Columbia University with a BA in Computer Science. In my free time these days I often work on small video games 
				and do freelance <a href="https://jasminedon.github.io/" target="_blank">website design</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In summer 2017 I worked at Autodesk SF and built some container monitoring tools for their cloud deployment pipeline. I'll be returning to work full-time in a month.
			</p>

			<h2><a href="https://foodbridge.herokuapp.com/">Fridge</a></h2>
			<p>
				Winner of People's Choice at the 2017 Code2040 Fellows Hackathon, Fridge aims to connect charities and food banks with companies and private events that end up with extra food.
			</p>

			<h2><a href="http://adriangarza.github.io/dnd/">D&amp;D</a></h2>
			<p>
				An all-in-one Dungeons and Dragons dice roller/item generator. A lot of the data was gathered from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BehindTheTables/">/r/BehindTheTables</a>, but a good deal of it is my own creation.
			</p>

			<h2><a href="http://adriangarza.github.io/terminal/">Terminal</a></h2>
			<p>
				An html/css/js terminal emulator. I made it in a day for a coding challenge and have since expanded upon it by adding various small, helpful functions.
			</p>

			<h1 id="games">Games</h1>

			<h2><a href="http://adriangarza.github.io/game-demo/">Vapor Trails</a></h2>
			<p>
				A 2D metroidvania. Open source and still in development.
			</p>

			<h2><a href="http://adriangarza.github.io/re/">/re/</a></h2>
			<p>
				My final project for my reincarnation class: a simple platformer where your past bodies stay in the level and need to be used to get past hazards and over gaps. Check out the source code <a href="http://github.com/adriangarza/re/">here</a>. 
			</p>

			<h2><a href="http://adriangarza.github.io/baristasim/">BaristaSim</a></h2>
			<p>
				Create endless, diverse coffee orders for a hungry, pumpkin-esque humanoid. There's a story in the works (much like the bartending game <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/447530/VA11_HallA_Cyberpunk_Bartender_Action/" target="_blank"> VA-11 Hall-A</a>) but for now, enjoy the faithful representation of making an endless stream of drinks for one volatile customer.
			</p>


			<h2><a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/morrow-peak/" target="_blank">Morrow Peak</a></h2>
			<p>
				A project that was never fully realized, Morrow Peak boasts an inventory system, full-featured NPC interactions, a hybrid 2D/2.5D system, and some of my finest pixel art and character animations. It also has three levels in total. 
			</p>

			<h1 id="fiction">Fiction</h1>
			<h2><a href="http://adriangarza.github.io/writing/timestamp/" target="_blank">Timestamp</a></h2>
			<p>
				The short story that inspired Morrow Peak. Or maybe it was the other way around. I recommend checking out both for the full experience.
			</p>

			<h2><a href="http://adriangarza.github.io/writing/soulrecall/" target="_blank">Soul Recall</a></h2>
			<p>
				A one-off short story about space travel and asteroid mining. It follows a specific found-documentation format from a short story class assignment.
			</p>
