Blender cheat sheet for my own personal reference.

### general
`~`: view-related things, like: move to selected, move to camera

`alt` + `G`: reset object position to origin

`alt` + `mmb`: snap orbit to axes

`ctrl` + `A`: apply scale, other things (applying scale is usually good to do if any procedural things downstream depend on the object)

`ctrl` + `tab`: switch modes if you get scared

`alt` + `S`: shrink/fatten tool shortcut

`P`: convert selection (in edit mode) to its own object, set parent otherwise

`L`: select LINKED over cursor

`shift`/`ctrl` + drag: smooth movement/incremental movement, works for nodes and numfields too

`H`: quick hide, like visgroups in Hammer

`/`: opposite (sorta), isolate the current object

`F`: hold, set size (for brush-based things)

`shift` + `F`: hold, set strength, again for brushes

`A`: select all (in whatever mode)

vertex groups are named values between 0 and 1 for each vertex on the mesh you paint in

`M`: (move) to new collection

`ctrl` + `L`: link (various data, like materials), select the linking template last


### animation

`I`: insert animation keyframe, brings up a menu

`ctrl` + `mmb`: drag to zoom timeline in the graph editor, which is like Unity's dopesheet

right click + show sliders in the timeline lets you edit properties there
