title:  "Basic Skeletal Animation in Unity"
---

I'm very lazy and dislike hand-animating. This is a problem in game development, so I have a workaround.

The above animation is skeletal instead of hand-drawn. Skeletal animation is nothing new, but at this resolution I can make it work effectively without looking like a mobile game.

## Process
##### 1. Add the pixel perfect camera

This is an official Unity asset available [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.pixel-perfect@1.0/manual/index.html). 
It renders everything to a smaller texture at runtime.

To save you the trouble of doing math, an 800Ã—450 texture will work out to a pixel scale of 2:1 at 900p and 1080p.
I import my sprites normally at 100 PPU, so each pixel is 0.01 units wide inside Unity.

##### 2. Draw sprite atlas

Hey, this looks large. This atlas is drawn at **8x** resolution. That's because pixel art can't hold its shape when it gets rotated, or else it gets jagged.

[RotSprite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel-art_scaling_algorithms#RotSprite) is an algorithm for smoothly rotating pixel art. We can't do this at runtime in Unity, but we can mimic one of its essential steps: scaling a sprite up by 8x before applying the transform.

**This sprite is imported at 800 PPU.**

##### 3. "Rig"
