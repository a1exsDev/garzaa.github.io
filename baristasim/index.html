            <p>
                BaristaSim is currently in development. The most recent build
                features a pumpkin-looking man who asks for infinite randomly generated
                coffees. Can you get his orders right?

Drag ingredients into the cup to make a coffee.
<br />
<br />
RULES
<br />
<br />
Every non-blended drink needs either a normal (dark) or decaf (light) coffee from one of the two coffee pots.
<br />
<br />
If the drink isn't iced or blended, the milks need to be added to the cup first and then warmed using the steamer attached to the espresso machine.
<br />
<br />
Steam levels are:<br />
	no steam<br />
	steamed (hot)<br />
	a little foam<br />
	a lot of foam<br />
<br />
A blended drink needs these ingredients, in this order:<br />
	blended drink mix<br />
	milks<br />
	ice<br />
<br />
Syrups need to be added to the cup last.
<br />
<br />
To add an espresso shot, the filters need to be unlocked from the espresso (turned left) and locked into the espresso grinder, where you'll need to grind the beans and then drag the handle down to tamp the grounds into the filter. Then lock the filter back into the machine and press the button.
<br />
<br />
If you mess up a drink, you can always throw it in the trash.
